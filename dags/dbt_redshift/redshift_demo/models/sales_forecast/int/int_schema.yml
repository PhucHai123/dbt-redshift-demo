      - name: type_scaled

        description: >
          A scaled version of the `type` column from the 'feature_prepare_cpi' table, calculated as (`type` - minimum `type`) / (maximum `type` - minimum `type`). This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `type` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.
      - name: cpi_avg_scaled
        type: float
        description: >
          A scaled version of the `cpi_avg` column from the 'feature_prepare_cpi' table, calculated as (`cpi_avg` - minimum `cpi_avg`) / (maximum `cpi_avg` - minimum `cpi_avg`). This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `cpi_avg` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.
      - name: temperature_avg_scaled
        type: float
        description: >
          A scaled version of the `temperature_avg` column from the 'feature_prepare_cpi' table, calculated as (`temperature_avg` - minimum `temperature_avg`) / (maximum `temperature_avg` - minimum `temperature_avg`). This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `temperature_avg` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.

        description: >
          A scaled version of the `fuel_price_avg` column from the 'feature_prepare_cpi' table, calculated as (`fuel_price_avg` - minimum `fuel_price_avg`) / (maximum `fuel_price_avg` - minimum `fuel_price_avg`). This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `fuel_price_avg` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.

          A scaled version of the `holiday_count` column from the 'feature_prepare_cpi' table, calculated as (`holiday_count` - minimum `holiday_count`) / (maximum `holiday_count` - minimum `holiday_count`). This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `holiday_count` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.

This scaling is necessary to ensure that the `unemployment_avg` column has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can improve the performance of the XGBoost classifier by reducing the effect of outliers and improving the model's ability to learn the relationships between features.
